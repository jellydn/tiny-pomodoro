## Codebase Patterns
- Use Expo as the React Native framework (recommended approach)
- Use `npx create-expo-app@latest <name> --template blank-typescript` for TypeScript projects
- Typecheck: `npx tsc --noEmit` in PomodoroTimer directory
- Run web dev: `npm run web` in PomodoroTimer directory (requires react-dom and react-native-web)
- Context pattern: create contexts in `contexts/` directory, export Provider and useX hook together
- Component pattern: create reusable components in `components/` directory

- Initialized React Native project with Expo + TypeScript template
- Added @react-native-async-storage/async-storage for local storage
- Added react-native-svg for circular progress indicator
- Typecheck passes successfully
- Files changed: Created PomodoroTimer/ directory with full Expo project
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - React Native CLI init is deprecated; use Expo's create-expo-app instead
  - The `blank-typescript` template provides TypeScript support out of the box
  - AsyncStorage and react-native-svg install cleanly with npm

- Created TimerContext with state: duration, remaining, isRunning, isPaused
- Implemented setDuration, start, pause, stop, reset actions
- Timer decrements remaining time every second using setInterval
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed: 
  - Created PomodoroTimer/contexts/TimerContext.tsx
  - Updated PomodoroTimer/App.tsx to use TimerProvider
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use useRef to store interval ID for proper cleanup
  - Context pattern: export both Provider component and useTimer hook
  - Clear interval when component unmounts or timer state changes

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bbb08-34be-7429-a3d9-a6898c221509
- Created PresetButtons component with 4 preset durations (25, 30, 45, 50 minutes)
- Selected preset is visually highlighted with blue background (#007AFF)
- Tapping a preset updates timer display immediately via setDuration
- Default selection is 25 minutes (matches DEFAULT_DURATION in TimerContext)
- Disabled preset buttons while timer is running
- Typecheck passes
- Files changed:
  - Created PomodoroTimer/components/PresetButtons.tsx
  - Updated PomodoroTimer/App.tsx to include PresetButtons and extracted MainScreen component
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Components go in `components/` directory
  - Web dev requires additional deps: react-dom and react-native-web (install with `npx expo install`)
  - Use TouchableOpacity for interactive buttons in React Native
  - Disable preset buttons while timer is running to prevent mid-session changes
